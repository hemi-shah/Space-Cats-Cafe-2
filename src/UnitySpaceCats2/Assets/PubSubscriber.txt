OrderManager
    Keeps track of the current order and the cat for that order
    List of methods to call when the order is ready (methods are just called Actions in C# because why not)
    Has method that gets called when the complete order button get clicked
        In this method, it calls every method in the list of subscribers (aka listeners), giving them the order and the drink
        

DrinkVerifier
    Has a method "subscribe" that tells ordermanager to add us to the list of methods to call when an order is complete
        We want to know when the order is complete!
        The method that it wants to be called when the order is complete is OnDrinkCompleted
    OnDrinkCompleted method gets called automatically by OrderManager when the order is complete
        It checks the order against the drink
